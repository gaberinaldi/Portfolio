# Portfolio

## Description

This project means a lot to me. I'm nearing the end of my University of California, Davis Development Bootcamp and this is my first big project on my own. This project is just a small fraction of everything I was able to learn and accomplish in a short duration of time. I have no doubt my skillset will continue to grow exponentially over the upcoming months. I made this portfolio to show my current skillset and also to present upcoming projects I will be working on upon completion. This project will allow future employers and clients to learn more about me, my style, and my work.
